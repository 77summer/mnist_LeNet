# MNIST recognition

implement the LeNet for digit recognition using frameworks as follows:

1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Caffe
4. PyTorch

## objective

My goal in this project is to get familiar with these frameworks.

## Why MNIST

MNIST seems to be a "hello world" in DL. And also a very good choice to get hands on CNN.
